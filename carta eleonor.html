        <h3>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
        <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent aplication to join us at the University of Awesome´s science faculty to study as part<br>
               of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.<br>
            
        <h3>Starting dates</h3>


        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br>
           could start at the beginning of a semester, the star dates for each one are as follows:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Please let me know if this ok, and if so which star date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website</p>


        <h3>Subjets of study</h3>


        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall <br>
           somewhere int the real of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
           the kind of person we´d like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br>
           by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>


        <ol>
            <li><p>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86ºF), when the <br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>> 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)<p></li>
            <li><p><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CCS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</p></li>
        </ol>


        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you´d expect the <br>
               research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we´d need to know? Thanks.</p>


        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>


        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>


        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>


            <dd><p>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr>BC</abbr> a whole village would dance around<br>
                in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be <q>fruitful</q>.</p></dd>

            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>


            <dd><p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
                involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably<br>
                tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br>
                modem styles such as Twerking.</p></dd>

            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>


            <dd><p>interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have<br>
                discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br>
                of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br>
                because they were really cold.</p></dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
